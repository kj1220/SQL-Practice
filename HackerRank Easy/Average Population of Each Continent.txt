Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

SELECT b.Continent, FLOOR(AVG(a.Population))
FROM City a
JOIN Country b
ON a.Countrycode = b.Code
GROUP BY b.Continent
